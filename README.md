# Perceptron-Using-Python
Perceptron network in Python with a dataset.
This is a program to implement perceptron algorithm in python.
Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy are used.
To know more about Pandas, visit:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/
for Numpy, visit:https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html.
Here inputs are taken from the dataset provided as the csv file.
Here the perceptron will classify wine as high quality and low quality based on the inputs provided.
Wine with quality > 5 are classified as high quality
and that with quality <= 5 are made as low quality.
